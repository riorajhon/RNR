web application + website

The aim is to help small businesses become better, by asking their customers what specific thing they can improve

The web application will generate a QR code. 
When a customer scans the QR code, they can rate the business from 1 to 10
The website will tell businesses owners what the application does
It is a sales website

This project brief is divided into 2 parts

Web application:
    What it does
    How it works
    User journey and process flow
Web site:
    10 Pages – Home, About Us, Contact, Data security, Sign Up page etc.
Web application
    The QR code says “Rate Us and win a free gift”
    When the customer scans the QR code, it opens a rating page(rating_page.png)
    If the rating is High (7 to 10), then the next page leads to the business’ public “Reviews” page. For example:(image1.png)
    If the rating is Low (1 to 6), then we ask the customer a few questions
        For example:
            Question 1: “What is 1 thing we can improve to make our business better?”
            Question 2: “Can you tell us 2 specific things that bothered you today?”
            Question 3: “Should we add more products, or new services?”
    web application should allow the business to:
        Type their own questions
        Decide how many questions to ask (between 1 and 3)
        Offer a free gift / free prize for providing the feedback, or not offer it
        Choose what prize to offer (upload description of prize + photo of prize – optional)
        If the customer wants the free gift, then to collect their name, e-mail address and mobile
    Generate the QR code to display at their cash counter
    Edit the text to be displayed below the QR code
        For example “Help Us Improve and win a free gift”
        Or leave it blank
        Print the QR code along with the footer text
    Log in to a dashboard which displays (Neatly, attractively and graphically)
        How many customers responded
        How many gave positive / negative reviews
        (editable field) – which URL the customer was sent - Customer ratings o Facebook, or Yelp etc. 
        Reviews organised by date and time (sortable columns)
        Customer’s e-mail addresses and mobile numbers captured
            Downloadable data in Excel 
    Edit settings for their dashboard
        Change password, Edit name, Upload their own profile photo
        Change their payment plan
        Cancel their subscription and delete their account
     web application should allow the business to change their payment plan
        $ 2 per month OR
        $20 per year (20% discount over the monthly plan)
    Both payment plans give access to all features
        QR code and Rating page
        Can log into account and edit:
            Which URL to send customers to if rating is 7 or above
            3 edit-able questions
            How many customers responded (show graphically)
            How many gave positive / negative reviews (show graphically)
            Free gift option – editable with text description and upload-able image of gift
            Customer’s email, mobile number and name database
            All features as described in the previous slide
    Payment Plan – This is part of the Web site, not the web application
    When the business clicks inside their dashboard on “Change payment plan” then bring them to the “Pricing” page on the website
    Let them select 1 of the 2 pricing plans - $2 per month, or $20 per year
    There are only 2 pricing plans
    The plans automatically renew every month / every year until cancelled
